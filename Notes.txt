First of all, the core contracts of ERC-3643 include the following:

Token
IdentityRegistry (IdentityRegistryStorage is optional)
ClaimIssuer
ClaimRegistry
Compliance.
Here's how you can proceed:

Decentralized Identity: ERC-3643 uses OnchainID (https://github.com/onchain-id) for decentralized identity management, which is a crucial part of the standard


### What is ERC-3643?
ERC-3643 is a revolutionary token standard designed specifically for Real-World Assets (RWAs) on the Ethereum blockchain. 
Unlike traditional standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721, ERC-3643 incorporates built-in compliance features, 
making it the first security token standard that ensures regulatory adherence while enabling secure digital representation of physical assets.

### Core Architecture & Components
The ERC-3643 standard consists of five main smart contract components:
1. **Token Contract** - Manages the tokenized asset itself
2. **IdentityRegistry** - Handles user identity verification and management
3. **ClaimIssuer** - Issues and manages compliance claims
4. **ClaimRegistry** - Stores and validates compliance claims
5. **Compliance Contract** - Enforces regulatory requirements and business rules

### Key Features & Capabilities

#### 1. Decentralized Identity Management
- Uses OnchainID for decentralized identity verification
- Eliminates reliance on central authorities for identity management
- Reduces risk of identity theft and fraud
- Enables self-sovereign identity for users

#### 2. Built-in Compliance Framework
- **KYC (Know Your Customer)**: Automated identity verification
- **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**: Built-in monitoring and reporting
- **Regulatory Transparency**: Clear audit trails for compliance
- **Adaptive Compliance**: Ability to update rules as regulations evolve

#### 3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Multiple verification layers for enhanced security
- Password + smartphone verification + biometric options
- Prevents unauthorized access to tokenized assets

#### 4. Fractional Ownership
- Enables division of high-value assets into smaller, tradable tokens
- Makes expensive assets (real estate, art, commodities) accessible to more investors
- Increases market liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets

#### 5. Smart Contract Security
- Regular audit mechanisms for vulnerability detection
- Automated compliance checks during transactions
- Transparent and immutable transaction records

### Tokenization Process
1. **Asset Identification** - Select the real-world asset to tokenize
2. **Token Creation** - Generate digital tokens representing the asset
3. **Compliance Verification** - Ensure regulatory requirements are met
4. **Distribution** - Make tokens available for trading

### Security Measures
- **Decentralized Identity**: On-chain identity verification
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Multiple verification layers
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular security assessments
- **Fraud Prevention**: Built-in mechanisms to prevent fraudulent claims

### Regulatory Benefits
- **Automatic Compliance**: KYC/AML rules embedded in smart contracts
- **Regulatory Transparency**: Easy demonstration of compliance
- **Jurisdictional Adaptability**: Flexible framework for different regulations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for regulatory reporting

### Market Applications
- **Real Estate**: Fractional property ownership
- **Art & Collectibles**: Digital representation of valuable items
- **Commodities**: Enhanced trading of physical commodities
- **Private Equity**: Tokenized investment opportunities

### Advantages Over Other Standards

#### vs ERC-20:
- Built-in compliance (ERC-20 lacks regulatory features)
- Enhanced security with identity verification
- Designed specifically for security tokens

#### vs ERC-721:
- Focus on fungible security tokens (vs unique NFTs)
- Regulatory compliance features
- Fractional ownership capabilities

### Enterprise Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: Robust framework for asset protection
- **Streamlined Processes**: Automated compliance and faster transactions
- **Cost Reduction**: Lower transaction fees and operational costs
- **Market Access**: Broader investor base through fractional ownership

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Asset Legitimacy**: Verification of underlying asset ownership
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting diverse jurisdictional requirements
3. **Security Concerns**: Protecting against fraud and unauthorized access

### Future Potential
- **Institutional Adoption**: Growing interest from major financial institutions
- **Market Growth**: Expanding tokenized asset market
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with existing financial systems
- **Scalability**: Solutions for handling increased transaction volumes

### Implementation Considerations
- **Legal Framework**: Understanding regional regulations
- **Technology Infrastructure**: Ensuring adequate blockchain capabilities
- **User Education**: Building awareness and trust in tokenization
- **Regulatory Engagement**: Working with legal experts for compliance

### Market Impact
ERC-3643 is transforming the financial landscape by:
- Making high-value assets accessible to more investors
- Reducing barriers to entry in traditionally exclusive markets
- Enhancing transparency and trust in asset trading
- Creating new investment opportunities and market liquidity

This standard represents a significant advancement in blockchain technology, 
bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets while ensuring regulatory compliance and security.


Tokenizing Everything
    Challenges  
        Follow All the regulations
        Bringing Bureaucracy on Chain 
        Smart Contract Upgrades 

ERC Standards 
    Make Audit Easy 
    Interoperability and Standardization to build better monitoring and Software tools 
    Better UX , as they folloe the standard 


ERC 7726 
    For Oracles to get Off chain data , on Chain 
    Standardize Oracle 
    Provides consistant data handling and fetching 
    Permissionless INtegration: Supports Permissionless oracles, Allows Governance Mechanism if necessary
        This flexibility enables developers to tailor their oracles to specific use cases while adhering to the standard.


ERC 3643 [Permissioned ERC 20]
    ERC 20 Compatible 
    All Wallets have a Valid Identity
        When This si deployed , a Smart contract will work as a identity provider.
        Can integrate also with OnchainID for KYC 
        Check Compliance for each transfer and gives compiance service 

Steps 
Sender --> Initaites a Transfer it interacts with the smart contract and check the compliance smart contract [Which fetches the identiy and fetch any rule we set[Ex: Whitelist etc..]] --> Passes the Transaction, if data is correct 

    Ex: Tokenize Real Estate Project 
        Shares will be tokenized and anyone can buy it  

        User is KYCed --> To Buy a Real Estate A , you should be a Indian Citizen[Rule 1] ---> To Buy more that 5 units you should be institutinal[ Rule 2] == Rule for Buying Real Estates 

            Trasnaction will  nto pass if any of the rule is not met and not hit 


Real World: KYC/AML --> Set compliance and regulatory Rules --> Add operation temas with licences 
Web3: setOnChainId (Function that Accepts a SMart contract address, It should handle all riules related to identity provider[Flexible based on product]) --> --> serComplicanceContract(Rules engine,has multiple mrules and cop;icane sc address is added) ---> addAgent (Compliance smart cotract should have some agent [Add people with flexible roles to be able to do more actions (People who manage the rules)])


Connecting Real WOrld Data to ERC 3643 [Bridge between Web2 and Web3]
    ERC 7726 : Oracle Adapter 
        Provides an adapter , a standard that works with token amounts instead of token prices
        Provides a quoteOf function that converts between token amounts while handling decimals internally 
        Oracles either return trusted values or revert , removing complexity from end apllications
        permissioless design that works with popular data sources like ChainLink
